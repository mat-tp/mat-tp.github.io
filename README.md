How to Run the Project Locally

To get started, follow these steps:

    Ensure Python 3 is Installed
    Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can check by running:

python3 --version

If it's not installed, download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Clone the Repository
Clone the project from my GitHub repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/mat-tp/mat-tp.github.io.git

Navigate into the Project Directory
Move into the project folder:

cd mat-tp.github.io

Install Dependencies
you can manually install Flask and other necessary packages:

pip install flask

Run the Application
Start the application with:

    python3 app.py

    Access the Portfolio
    Once the server starts, you'll see a link in the terminal. Copy and paste this link into your browser to view my portfolio with all the styling and features working as intended.

I attempted to host the project on GitHub Pages, but the styling and functionality were not fully supported there.

Hope you enjoy exploring my work!
