    <!--Project 3: AI search algo Agent ( Java Implemented and React implemented-->
  <h2>Vacuum Cleaner Agent & Pathfinding Visualizer</h2>
    <p>Developed a dual-version project showcasing AI pathfinding and search algorithms. The core logic, implemented in Java, simulates a vacuum cleaner agent efficiently navigating and cleaning a 2D environment using the A* algorithm and Variable Cell Automata (VCA) for intelligent decision-making.  This project demonstrates the practical application of graph theory principles in a grid-based system.</p>
    <p><strong>Language and Technology:</strong> Java, React, TypeScript,Html and css</p>
